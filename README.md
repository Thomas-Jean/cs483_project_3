# cs483_project_3

By default the makefile creates only the requested files for this project, however if you need the old jars for testing, they can be created with this makefile.

As an example if you need the jar for rsa-enc, you can run "make RSAEnc.jar" and the jar will be created,so the jars for the CBC portion of project 1 and the jars from project 2 can be created if needed for testing.
